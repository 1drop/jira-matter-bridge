# JIRA Mattermost Webhook Bridge

Serves as a bridge that translates the JIRA webhooks into Mattermost webhooks.
## Configuration
Set the following environment variables to provide the Mattermost server details:
* MATTERMOST_SERVER_PORT - Default: 80
* MATTERMOST_SERVER_PATH - Default: /hooks/<incoming hookid>
* MATTERMOST_SERVER_PROTO - Default: http
* MATTERMOST_SERVER - Default: localhost

## Integration
* Install the required modules by running `npm install`
* Start the app by running `npm start`
* Configure Mattermost server and create a new [incoming webhooks](https://github.com/mattermost/platform/blob/master/doc/integrations/webhooks/Incoming-Webhooks.md) and note the hook-id (the part that appears after `hooks` in the hook URL.
* Configure JIRA Webhooks to forward the hook (for the required JQL) to `http://<jira-matter-bridge-server>:3000/hooks/<mattermost hook id>`
* That's it.
